# resonant words, resonant phrases
#### a max patch inspired by alvin lucier for a trans harsh noise record

### the record
this patch was developed on a cold october afternoon in portland, oregon, for the production of [resonant words, resonant phrases](https://xxylecomputer.bandcamp.com/album/resonant-words-resonant-phrases). it was inspired in no small degree by [alvin lucier's I Am Sitting In A Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAxHlLK3Oyk). trans rights are human rights. 

### setup

this patch assumes that you are using a mixer with a cheap usb audio interface to record audio from a microphone. plug your mixer's audio out into the interface. plug your interface's audio out into the line-in of a handheld audio recorder and then plug the interface into your personal computer.

open sittinginaroom.maxpat with max 8. previous versions of max may work but are untested. configure your max audio input to your interface's output, and the max audio output to your interface's input. this should set up the signal loop.

follow the on-screen instructions for setting loop overall duration and playback offset. activate your microphone in the max patch. when you are ready, hit record on your audio recorder and then hit the big toggle under step 4: "start recording / playback." recite what you have to and let the audio feed back. stop recording. congratulations u are now a noise musician.
